# Text_To_Binary_By_CPP
Text file converting into Binary file and again retrive Text file from the Binay File. Using a dictionary which created by applying Huffman Algorithm. Here I used C++ programming language.
Be careful to trying this demo because this dictionary does not contain all ASCII characters.
